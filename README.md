# telegram-mockbot
This is my first proyect to test the main functioning of a telegram api bot. 

The pom.xml file contains the necessary dependencies to work on a maven environment.

## The Procfile

Procfile is just a necessary file for running the proyect on the Heroku Cloud. The file just describes the command that the Heroku container should run when starting the application.
